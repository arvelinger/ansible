# Boilerplates for Automation and Deployment

These are my templates and configurations I use in various projects and deployment scenarios. They are based on automation and deployment tools such as [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#installing-ansible-on-ubuntu), [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/), and much more.

I created them as free resources to be extended by you according to your specific use cases.
